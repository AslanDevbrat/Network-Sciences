<div class=""><p>Consider a <em>k</em>-regular undirected network (i.e., a
network in which every vertex has de- gree <em>k</em>).</p>
<p>a) Show that the vector <strong>1</strong> = (1, 1, 1, . . .) is
an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix with eigenvalue
<em>k</em>.</p>
<p>b) By making use of the fact that eigenvectors are orthogonal
(or otherwise), show that there is no other eigenvector that has
all elements positive. The Perronâ€“Frobenius theorem says that the
eigenvector with all elements positive has the largest eigen-
value, and hence the eigenvector <strong>1</strong> gives, by
definition, the eigenvector centrality of our <em>k</em>-regular
network and the centralities are the same for every vertex.</p>
<p>c) Find the Katz centralities of all vertices in a
<em>k</em>-regular network.</p>
<p>d) You should have found that , as with eigenvector centrality,
the Katz centralities of all vertices in the network are the same.
Name a centrality measure that could give different centralities
for different vertices in a regular network.</p>
