<div class=""><p>Consider a <em>k</em>-regular undirected network (i.e., a
network in which every vertex has degree <em>k)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(p.232)</strong></p>
<p>a) Show that the vector <strong>1</strong> =(1,1,1,…) is an
eigenvector of the adjacency matrix with eigenvalue <em>k</em>.</p>
<p>b) By making use of the fact that eigenvectors are orthogonal
(or otherwise), show that there is no other eigenvector that has
all elements positive. The Perron-Frobenius theorem says that the
eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue always has all elements
non-negative (see footnote 2 on page 346), and hence the
eigenvector <strong>1</strong> gives, by definition, the
eigenvector centrality of our <em>k</em>-regular network and the
centralities are the same for every vertex.</p>
<p>c) Find the Katz centralities of all vertices in a
<em>k</em>-regular network.</p>
<p>d) You should have found that, as with the eigenvector
centrality, the Katz centralities of all vertices in the network
are the same. Name a centrality measure that could give different
centrality values for different vertices in a regular network.</p>
