<div class="answer-given-body ugc-base">
<p>Betweenness Centrality of a node n is the ratio of the shortest
paths between all other nodes, that pass through node n.</p>
<p>This can be expressed as difference between number of shortest
paths between any 2 vertices in the tree and the shortest path
between any 2 vertices in the disjointed
regions-n1,n2,n3,....nk</p>
<p>= n*n - (n1*n1 + n2*n2 + n3*n3 +.... + nk*nk)</p>
<p>= n^2 - Sigma(1,k) ni^2</p>
